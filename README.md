# Banking Management System #
This is a web-based Banking Management System developed using PHP, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and CSS. It includes features such as email notifications using PHP Mailer.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements ##
- XAMPP (or any local PHP server)
- A web browser
- Internet access for PHP Mailer to function

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project ##
1. Set Up XAMPP
- Install XAMPP if you havenâ€™t already.
- Navigate to C:\xampp\htdocs (this is the root directory for your local server).
- Clone this project into the htdocs directory.

2. Configure Email
- Open the email.php file inside the project
- Replace the placeholder email and password with your actual email credentials.

3. Login to that email account and enable Less Secure App Access (found in your email account's security settings). This is required for PHP Mailer to work.
- Start the Server
- Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
- Start both Apache and MySQL.

4. Access the Project
- Open a web browser and visit: http://localhost/[project-folder-name]

## ðŸ“¬ Notes ##
Make sure your email account allows third-party access; otherwise, email functionality will fail.

If using Gmail, you may need to create an App Password instead of using your main email password.
